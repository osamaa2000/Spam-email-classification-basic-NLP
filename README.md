# Spam-email-classification-basic-NLP

Welcome to the Spam vs. Non-Spam Email Classifier repository! This project aims to develop a spam email classifier using traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. It provides hands-on experience in feature engineering, model selection, and implementation.

We use a publicly available dataset of labeled spam and non-spam (ham) emails. The project involves:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Loading the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling missing data, and text preprocessing (removing stop words, punctuation, and tokenization).
- **Feature Engineering:** Representing text data using TF-IDF or word embeddings, and extracting features like email length and presence of hyperlinks.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing at least two ML algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression), evaluating them with metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), and tuning hyperparameters.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Developing a neural network using TensorFlow or PyTorch, experimenting with different architectures, and evaluating the model's performance.

This repository provides a structured approach to spam email classification, combining both ML and DL methods. Explore, contribute, and enhance the project to build a robust spam classifier.
